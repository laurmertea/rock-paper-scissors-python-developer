# Description
# Rock, paper, scissors is a well-known hand game. 
# Each one of two players simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hands, 
# and then, depending on the chosen shapes, the winner is determined: 
# rock beats scissors, 
# paper wins over rock, 
# scissors beat paper.
# The game is widely used to make a fair decision between equal options.
#
# So, let's start with an unfair version! :)
#
# Write a program that reads input specifying which option the user has chosen. 
# Then your program should make the user lose! 
# That is, your program should always choose an option that defeats the one picked by the user. 
# After finding this option, output a line Sorry, but the computer chose <option>, 
# where <option> is the name of option that the program picked depending on the user's input.
# For example, if the user enters rock, the program should print Sorry, but the computer chose paper and so on.
#
# Please, pay attention to the format of the output. 
# It should be exactly the same as in the example, 
# including capital letters and punctuation. 
# No additional strings should be printed!
#
# Objectives
# Your program should:
# Take an input from the user
# Find an option that wins over the user's option
# Output a line: Sorry, but the computer chose <option>
#
# Examples
# The greater-than symbol followed by space (> ) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.
# 
# Example 1
# > scissors
# Sorry, but the computer chose rock
#
# Example 2
# > paper
# Sorry, but the computer chose scissors
