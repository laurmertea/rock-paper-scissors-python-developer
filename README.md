# rock-paper-scissors-python-developer
A simple project involving a Rock-Paper-Scissor simulator (as seen on the JetBrains Academy / Hyperskill Python developer plan)

### About
If you’ve ever wanted to create games, this project will get you started! In this project you will code a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game, a more advanced version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, which can be played against the computer.

### Learning outcomes
A playable Rock-Paper-Scissors game, with a Player vs Computer mode. Practice using arrays, the Random library, formatted strings, and algorithms.

### Stage 1/5: Unfair computer
Before learning how to play the game properly, let’s learn how to cheat! Using conditional statements, you’ll write a program that always defeats the human player in the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

### Stage 2/5: Equalizing chances
Let’s not mess with the player too much, though: from now on, we’re going to play fair. You’ll be able to do this with the help of the random module, while string formatting will assist you in announcing the end result of the game.
