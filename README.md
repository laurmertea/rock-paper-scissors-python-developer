# rock-paper-scissors-python-developer
A simple project involving a Rock-Paper-Scissor simulator (as seen on the JetBrains Academy / Hyperskill Python developer plan)

### About
If you’ve ever wanted to create games, this project will get you started! In this project you will code a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game, a more advanced version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, which can be played against the computer.

### Learning outcomes
A playable Rock-Paper-Scissors game, with a Player vs Computer mode. Practice using arrays, the Random library, formatted strings, and algorithms.

### Stage 1/5: Unfair computer
Before learning how to play the game properly, let’s learn how to cheat! Using conditional statements, you’ll write a program that always defeats the human player in the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
